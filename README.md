Hi! 👋




You've opened the IDE Sandbox. 🎉

The Sandbox is an environment that you can access on "readme" and "code-along" lessons in Learn. It's a great place to experiment with code when you're not working on a "lab" (labs open the IDE In Browser).

The work you do in the Sandbox will be saved from lesson to lesson, and is automatically saved on your behalf to a repository in your GitHub account called `learn-co-sandbox`.

 [2,4,5,"jj",[1,2,4],7,['kk','jj','tt']].select{|num| num.is_a? (Array)}
 nested_students = [
  ["Mike", "Grade 10", "A average"],
  ["Tim", "Grade 10", "C average"],
  ["Monique", "Grade 11", "B average", "Class President"]
]
 
nested_students.each do |student_array|

  puts student_array
end
 
Please DO NOT touch this repository in GitHub, as it will affect your Sandbox experience, and potentially cause your work to be out of sync.

  # #inspect returns a human-readable representation
